This dataset contains files associated with the occupancy modeling completed for the project: eDNA monitoring of a rare salamander: The use of eDNA in detection of Eurycea junaluska in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (https://www.herpconbio.org/Volume_20/Issue_3/Brammell_etal_2025.pdf). The ShinyApp R program found here was downloaded from: https://github.com/AlexDiana/eDNAShinyApp/blob/main/ShinyApp.zip. The associated publication is found below, the modeling approach from Diana et al. 2021 is described and cited in the text of the E. junaluska eDNA publication.
